## Rules:
-

## Best Practices:
- Name your code files name.cpp, where name is a name of your choosing, and .cpp is the 
extension that indicates the file is a C++ source file.
- Create a new project for each new program you write.
- Use the debug build configuration when developing your programs. When you’re ready to 
release your executable to others, or want to test performance, use the release build configuration.
- Disable compiler extensions to ensure your programs (and coding practices) remain compliant 
with C++ standards and will work on any system.
- Don’t let warnings pile up. Resolve them as you encounter them (as if they were errors).
- Turn your warning levels up to the maximum, especially while you are learning. It will help you identify possible issues.
- 

## Warnings:
-

## Keep in mind:
- For GCC/G++, you can pass compiler flags -std=c++11, -std=c++14, -std=c++17, or -std=c++2a 
to enable C++11/14/17/2a support respectively.

## Useful Ubuntu commands
- To check the default c++ compiler standard in ubuntu terminal: 'g++ -dM -E -x c++  /dev/null | grep -F __cplusplus'

### What is C++ good at?
    C++ excels in situations where high performance and precise control over memory and 
    other resources is needed. Here are a few common types of applications that most likely 
    would be written in C++:
    - Video games
    - Real-time systems (e.g. for transportation, manufacturing, etc…)
    - High-performance financial applications (e.g. high frequency trading)
    - Graphical applications and simulations
    - Productivity / office applications
    - Embedded software
    - Audio and video processing
